# Processing_code folder

This folder contains code for processing data.

It's the same code done 3 times:

* First, there is an R script--'processingcode.R'--that you can run which does all the cleaning.
*  Make sure to run this script before you try to run the third file, 'processingfile_v2.qmd', since the code is pulled from the R script.
* Second, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script--'processingfile_v1'.
* Third, is a Quarto file--'processingfile_v2.qmd'--with an approach where the code is pulled in from the R script and run.
