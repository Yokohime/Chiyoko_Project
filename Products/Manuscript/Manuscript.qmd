# Summary/Abstract

*For Project 2, I used the cleaned Palmer Penguin data from project 1
and analyzed the data, creating graphs and figures to better visualize
the data. Graphs were made based off of 3 main questions I wanted to
answer about the Palmer Penguin dataset.*

# Introduction

## General Background Information

*Starting from Project 1, I used the Palmer Penguin dataset
[@manual:2020] and cleaned it using Rstudio. This project--Project
2--aims to answer questions based on the clean data, again using Rstudio
to make graphs and plots to help visualize the data.*

## Description of data and data source

*The Palmer Penguins dataset is of morphometric data from three species
of Antarctia penguins--Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae), Gentoo
penguin (Pygoscelis papua) and Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis
antarctica)-- such as: gender, flipper length, culmen length, culmen
depth, island, and more.*

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

*Our research questions are:*

*1.Is there any differences seen between the two sex of penguins?*

*2.Are there really 3 groups of penguins based off the data?*

*3.Is there any differences seen between the Islands?*

# Methods

*Using Rstudio, the Palmer Penguin set was cleaned by checking for
errors and NA values in the data by using "skimr::skim", "unique", and
view scatterplots to identify outliers.Then using the clean data, graphs
and plots were made to help visualize the data.Packages required were:
dplyr and tidyr for data processing and cleaning, skimr and lattice for
nice visualization.*

## Data acquisition, import and cleaning

*Data was obtained from an online source mbutler808(2023)
Project-template\[https://github.com/mbutler808/Project-template.git\]
using the penguins_raw_dirty.csv file. This data is based off the Palmer
Penguin dataset[@manual:2020]. I cloned this GitHub repository onto my
computer and opened the Processingcode.R which can be found in the
GitHub repository linked above under
Project-template/Code/Processing_code/processingcode.R. From here, I
cleaned the data using the script written and saved the file as
penguins.csv under Data/Processed_data/. The script was checked by
closing Rstudio and reopening it, deleting the Environment history, and
running "source("processingcode.R") in a new terminal to make sure it
runs without error and to make sure it has an output file. After, the
penguins.csv file was loaded into a new R script using the
path:data_path \<- "../../Data/Processed_data/".*

#Cleaning script

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("processingcode.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())
```

*Data was uploaded, checked for errors, and then plotted/graphed to help
visualize the data. "plot" was used to look at the overall comparison
between sex of the penguins and body mass (g), culmen length (mm),
culmen depth (mm), and flipper length (mm). Then, each individual
species was plotted to determine if there was a difference in sex within
species. For the second question, "xyplot" was used to create
scatterplots for each species next to each other while comparing body
mass(g), culmen length (mm), culmen depth (mm), and flipper length (mm).
Fianlly, to question the third question, both "plot" and "xyplot" were
used to visualize data comparing the penguins to see if there was a
difference between islands.*

#Anaylsis script

```{r, include=FALSE}
source("Anaylsis_Penguins.R", local = knitr::knit_global())
# or sys.source("your-script.R", envir = knitr::knit_global())
```

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

## Sex

There appears to be a difference between female and male penguins, with
males having higher body mass (g), culmen depth (mm), culmen length
(mm), and flipper size (mm).

```{r}
#| label: fig-penguin_sex-Comp
#| fig-cap: "Comparison between gender and body mass, culmen depth, culmen length, and flipper length respectively."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/All_Sex_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/ALL_Sex_CD.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/All_Sex_CL.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/All_Sex_FL.png")
```

Difference between the sex of Adelie penguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Adelie specific gender comparison
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/A_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/A_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/A_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/A_BM.png")
```

Difference between the sex of Gentoo penguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Gentoo specific gender comparison
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/G_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/G_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/G_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/G_BM.png")
```

Difference between the sex of Chinstrap penguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-Chinstrap specific gender comparison
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/C_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/C_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/C_BM.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/C_BM.png")
```

The Gentoo penguin seem to have a higher body mass, culmen length, and
flipper length when compare to the Adelie and Chinstrap.When looking at
the culmen length and culmen depth, the Adelie have a lower culmen
length but a higher culmen depth than both the Chinstrap and
Gentoo(@fig-species_comparison).

```{r}
#| label: fig-species_comparison
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of body mass, culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length of all species"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Species_BMvCD.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Species_BMvCL.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Species_BMvFL.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Species_CLvCD.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Species_CLvFL.png")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-mass_species_island_density
#| fig-cap: "Comparison of body mass, culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length of all Islands."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_BMvCD.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_BMvCL.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_BMvFL.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_CLvCD.png")
knitr::include_graphics("../../Products/Manuscript//images/Island_CLvFL.png")
```

## Further analyses 

Based on the graphs created, there were some interesting points that
would be worth looking further into. The body mass on Biscoe was higher
than that of Dream Island and Torgersen.It would be interesting to look
into this and identify if this was due to a certain species of penguins
being more abundant on this island. We should also take into account the
size of the island and the distance between all three islands.
Similarly, it is noted that there was not an equal amount of each three
species sampled in the original dataset which might skew the data in
favor of one species over another.

Following the first idea, we noticed that the Gentoo Penguins have
higher body mass than the other two species and noticed that Biscoe
Island had the most amount of penguins sampled while Torgersen had the
least amount sampled from. It would be interesting to look into the diet
of the penguins since there was also a difference in culmen depth,
culmen length, and flipper length between the penguins.

Finally, to ensure that there is a significant difference, we can
actually perform an anova for these questions to identify if there is a
difference. This would give us a statistical value which would help
support our figures above.

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

For this project, the cleaned data was taken and analyzed using Rstudio
to make graphs and plots to help visualize the data. Three questions
were posed at the beginning, 1. Is there a difference between the sex of
penguins, 2. Are there really three groups of penguins--Adelie, Gentoo,
and Chinstrap, and 3. Is there an difference between the islands? For
all three questions, all continuous data was used to help analyze the
data. Bar plots and comparative scatter plots were made to help visual
data to help answer our questions.

## Strengths and Limitations

This analysis looked at all the data presented to get an overall visual
of the data to answer these questions. Further analysis should be done
to better support these findings and more data is needed to help balance
the species and island comparisons as they were not sampled from equally
and having more data points in one over the other two might greatly skew
the results.

## Conclusions

To summarize, we found that 1. There is a difference between the sex of
penguins, and more specifically, there is a difference between sex of
all three species of penguins individually--with males having higher
values in body mass, culmen length, culmen depth, and flipper length. 2.
There are three distinct species of penguins based off the dataset, with
Gentoo and Adelie having features that stick out, such as higher body
mass and flipper length or higher culmen depth. 3. There is a difference
between the islands as Biscoe Island had higher body mass than the other
two. Dream Island also had a wider range of culmmen length when compared
to Torgersen Island and Biscoe Island.
